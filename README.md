## Image Classification Using VGG-16 ##

### Overview ###

This project uses VGG-16, a deep convolutional neural network, for image classification. It demonstrates transfer learning on a custom dataset, applying data augmentation to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

### Features ###

Transfer learning with pretrained VGG-16 weights from ImageNet

Data augmentation: rotation, flipping, scaling, and cropping

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Prediction visualization using confusion matrices and Grad-CAM heatmaps

### Skills & Tools ###

1) Python, TensorFlow/Keras

2) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

3) Data preprocessing and augmentation

4) Model evaluation and visualization

### Potential Applications ###

Satellite image classification for land use or object detection

Medical imaging or any multi-class image classification problem
